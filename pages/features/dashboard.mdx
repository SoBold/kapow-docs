# Dashboard

New Kapow Dashboard will be the first to adopt a new folder structure and a new workflow in terms of file placement.
The new folder structure will try and follow some of the concepts of `Next.js`, this should make it easy for a rebuild in the future, allowing us to use a design pattern we're already familiar with.

The folder structure will be the following:
<Callout>
    The folder structure assumes all other files and directories are left untouched
</Callout>

<FileTree>
    <FileTree.Folder name="core" open={true}>
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="src" open={true}>
        <FileTree.Folder name="blocks" open={true}>
            <FileTree.Folder name="..." open={true}>
            </FileTree.Folder>
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="components" open={true}>
            <FileTree.Folder name="button" open={true}>
                <FileTree.File name="button.php" />
                <FileTree.File name="_button.scss" />
                <FileTree.File name="_button.js" />
            </FileTree.Folder>
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="layouts" open={true}>
            <FileTree.Folder name="..." open={true}>
            </FileTree.Folder>
        </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

- `src` Component-first folder.
- `blocks` Blocks folder: acf blocks, flexible content.
- `components` Components folder: anything that makes a block.
- `layouts` Layouts folder: repeated structures across the site (e.g. Nav, Headers).
- `core` PHP logic responsible for the behaviour of src.

## `src` folder

This folder will hold every file, with a compoent-first approach, for a max of two-levels of depth.

Inside a single `[component|block|layout]` folder there will be `php`, `scss` & `js`.

`scss` and `js` files are underscored for convention.

## `core` folder

This folder will hold every file pertaining the logic of `src`, spanning from render functions and utilities.

Business logic won't be in this file.
