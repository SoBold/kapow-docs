# Components Router

The new components router will allow a more streamlined use of components and blocks within a template.
Dashboard will be the first feature to use this updated flow.

## Folder structure

The following one will be the new folder structure.

<FileTree>
    <FileTree.Folder name="core" open={true}>
        <FileTree.File name="Component.php" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="src" open={true}>
        <FileTree.Folder name="blocks" open={true}>
            <FileTree.Folder name="..." open={true}>
            </FileTree.Folder>
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="components" open={true}>
            <FileTree.Folder name="button" open={true}>
                <FileTree.File name="button.php" />
                <FileTree.File name="button.scss" />
                <FileTree.File name="_button.js" />
            </FileTree.Folder>
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="layouts" open={true}>
            <FileTree.Folder name="..." open={true}>
            </FileTree.Folder>
        </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

- `src` Component-first folder.
- `blocks` Blocks folder: acf blocks, flexible content.
- `components` Components folder: anything that makes a block.
- `layouts` Layouts folder: repeated structures across the site (e.g. Nav, Headers).
- `core` PHP logic responsible for the behaviour of src.

## `src` folder

This folder will hold every file, with a component-first approach, for a max of two-levels of depth.

<Callout type="warning">
    Having three or more levels (e.g. `./src/components/subfolder/sample/sample.php`) is not permitted
</Callout>

Inside a single `[component|block|layout]` folder there will be `php`, `scss` & `js`.

`scss` files are underscored for convention.

### PHP files in src

PHP files can be named freely, but is best practice to call them like the parent folder (e.g. `./src/blocks/button/button.php)

`Component.php` will get the file and is, in its essence, a wrapper for `get_template_part()`, therefore passing `$args` is common practice.

The recommeneded usage of args in a php file is as follows:

```php
$heading = $args['heading'] ?? 'default value';
$expectedArray = $args['cards'] ?? [];
$expectedBoolean = $args['toggle'] ?? false;
```
Having `$args` collected using `extract()` is discouraged as it opens up for security issues, using [array destructuring](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php) is also discouraged as it could potentially cause warnings if components are not provided with exactly the `$args` they're expecting.

### SCSS in src

SCSS files are to be used within each folder, conventionally named like the php file, prepended with an underscore (e.g. `_sample.scss).

A `_app.scss` file lives in `./src` and is responsible for the imports of all these files.

### JS in src

JS files are to be named exactly like the php file, this allows for automatic enqueueing using a `wp_footer` hook.

JS files that are used as payload from an ajax call that introduces a new component are to be required in that component through a `<script>` tag.

```html
<script async defer src="<?= get_template_directory_uri() . '/src/components/sample/specialfile.js'; ?>"></script>
```
<Callout type="warning">
    `async` and `defer` are used so the execution is delayed and doesn't disrupt the page.
</Callout>

More is explained in the Component.php section.

## `core` folder

This folder will hold every file pertaining the logic of `src`, spanning from render functions and utilities.

### `Component.php`

This file has `get()` as its main method. This method is public and static, meant to be used across template files and inner files (components, blocks and layouts).

Simple usage:

```php
<?= Component::get('components/sample/sample'); ?>
```

Passing args:

```php
<?= Component::get('components/sample/sample', [
    'foo' => 'bar',
]); ?>
```

<Callout type="warning">
    The `get` method only returns the requested component, `echo` (or `<?=`) will be needed to output content
</Callout>

***

For `js` files, a static property `$scripts` is updated at runtime with all the found files from `get()` calls.

The `$scripts` array is updated only with the first instance of the same-name `get()` call, ensuring no files are listed (or enqueued) twice.

In `functions.php` a `wp_footer` hook will call `enqueueScripts()` from `Component.php`. This function wil enqueue all scripts present in `$scripts` using async strategy and adding them in the footer.

## Design Patterns

Whenever the keyword any is used in this section: Template, Blocks and Layouts are assumed.
The common use-cases inside `./src` are 3:

- Template calls `layout`
- Template calls `blocks`
- Any calls `component`

The first two can be ignored, as they have a direct relationship, the parent calls one instance of the child.

The last instance though, could be simple or looped:
- The parent calls one component, and no other steps are required.\
- The parent has to call a component `n` times.

### Loop pattern
Let's take a tag component as example.\
This component is meant to appear as a little pill-shaped tag, with some border-radius and a little border.\
The restraints we need to put in place to allow for a simple usage are:
- The tag style goes from the tag itself up until the border, no outer box-model property is defined by the tag itself.
- The positioning of the tag is left static and never modified by the tag's style.
- No JS should be added for this component.

Considering these 3 points we can then define another element TODO CONTINUE
